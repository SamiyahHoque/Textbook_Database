# SBU-Textbook-Database

The SBU Textbook Database is a form that allows the user to add, retrieve, and delete books from the textbook database. The database stores ISBN, name, price, and edition fields. The changes made each time are stored in a local SQL database on my computer. It does not add a song if all the required fields are not filled, does not delete a row unless a row is selected, and does not retrieve a book unless an ISBN number is typed.

What I learned/Concepts Used:
- Java, mySQL
- JDBC
- WindowBuilder in eclipse
- MySQL workbench
- Error checking, dialog windows

Things to work on:
- Error checking for the ISBN number
- Update row functionality
